# Variable Names

If you are using ROOTbrowser to look at the datasets, here are the definitions of the variables.

When there are two leptons present in the final state they are ordered by transverse momentum with the "leading lepton" having the highest transverse momentum and the â€œtrailing lepton" having the next highest value.

Take a look at [ATLAS events](https://www.gitbook.com/book/cheatham1/get-started/edit#/edit/master/atlas_events.md) chapter for discussion of primary vertex and [Glossary](https://www.gitbook.com/book/cheatham1/get-started/edit#/edit/master/GLOSSARY.md) chapter for explanation of ATLAS coordinate system.
